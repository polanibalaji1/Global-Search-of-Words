# Global-Search-of-Words
    Searching a word in document is a very critical task in the case when the document is of very large size. It takes a lot of time and it’s not flexible, in order to make the task easier this project is developed. In this project, we are able to search a word such that we can get all the documents which consist of that word.   Consider an example, if you want to find a question in a set of previous papers we have to search every question in every paper which is not a simpler task in order to reduce this complexity we are using Global Search of Words. So that we can get all the documents which consists of that word without referring to a single document.

    Coming to the working of this project, here we have to navigate through two interfaces. One interface is Uploading and the other is Search. In Upload interface, we have to upload the path file .So that we get all the words which are filtering using Bloom’s Filter. We have to upload all the files in order to filter them using Bloom’s Filter. After Uploading we have to navigate to search interface where our vital task has to be done. In the text field we have to give the word which has to be search. In the text area we can find list of all the documents which consists of that word.
