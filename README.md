# Global-Search-of-Words
 * Searching a word in document is a very critical task in the case when the document is of very large size. 
 * It takes a lot of time and it’s not flexible, in order to make the task easier this project is developed.
 * In this project, we are able to search a word such that we can get all the documents which consist of that word. 
 * Consider an example, if you want to find a question in a set of previous papers we have to search every question in every paper.
 * Which is not a simpler task in order to reduce this complexity we are using Global Search of Words.
 * So that we can get all the documents which consists of that word without referring to a single document.

   * We have to upload all the files in order to filter them using Bloom’s Filter. 
   * After Uploading we have to navigate to search interface where our vital task has to be done. 
   * In the text field we have to give the word which has to be search. 
   * In the text area we can find list of all the documents which consists of that word.
